Sixwar is a simple strategy game where you move your units around a board trying to eliminate the other player.

RULES
To move a unit, click any hex with one of your armies in it, and click a destination hex.
You must leave at least one unit in an occupied hex, so hexes with only one unit are not eligible for movement.
When you are finished moving, press the End Turn button to allow your opponent to move.

COMBAT
If the destination hex is occupied, the faction with the highest number of participating units wins control of the hex.

REINFORCEMENTS
At the end of each turn, each occupied hex generates an additional army.

WINNING
A player wins the round if the opposing player no longer has any units to move.
